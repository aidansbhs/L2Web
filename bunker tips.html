                    Ok so hopefully you are ahead of the current situation and decided to build a bunker, great! But here is a quick guide if you don't already have a bunker built. First of all, order some shipping containers, as these will be the base of your shelter. Shipping containers are probably the easiest to obtain and build with so that's why we choose them for this guide. Though there are many different types of shelters and bases that you can have as well such as tubes and more. Now dig a hole at least 2 feet deeper than the height of the shipping containers. Pour concrete stairs leading down to the bunker, use I-beams to support the entryway roof, place corrugated steel or any other strong material across the top of the container as a base for the concrete roof, weld a re-bar frame around the stairs, add blocks to the rebar and fill with concrete, pour a 6-inch layer of concrete over the top to insulate and strengthen the roof, plant grass and bushes above the bunker to camouflage it. That should be most of the basics done, though don't hesitate to strengthen your bunker more. Remember to reinforce weakened areas of the shipping containers.
