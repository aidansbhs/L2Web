                <p> Ok so hopefully you are ahead of the current situation and decided to build a bunker, great! So here is a quick guide if you don't already have a bunker built. First of all, order some shipping containers, as these will be the base of your shelter. Shipping containers are probably the easiest to obtain and build with so that's why we choose them for this guide. Though there are many differant types of shelters and bases that you can have as well such as tubes and more. Now dig a hole at least 2 feet deeper than the height of the shipping containers. Pour concrete stairs leading down to the bunker, use I-beams to support the entryway roof, place corrugated steel or any other strong material across the top of the container as a base for the concrete roof, weld a re-bar frame around the stairs, add blocks to the rebar and fill with concrete, pour a 6-inch layer of concrete over the top to insulate and strengthn the roof, plant grass and bushes above the bunker to camouflage it. That should be most of the basics done, though don't hesistate to strenghten your bunker more. Remeber to reinforce weakened areas of the shipping containers. </p>

                <p> Now we are going to prepare your items and other important things you will need before you start living in your bunker. Your main priority is securing food, water and oxygen, you will most defintaley need oxygen. The rest can come later. </p>

                <p> 1. An air ventilation system is a must, make sure to get a sturdy one that will be able to keep going during a storm or with bombs going off. Another big factor is the amount of people you are storing, as you will need to take this into account when determining how much air you will use. The fewer the better in this case. </p>

                <p> 2. Water, water is an another essential item you will need. Theoretically you can last three days without water, but lets not let it get down to that. So supplying your bunker with a huge amount of water, prefferably in jugs or bottles which have been treated to last longer. As there is no telling how long you might be stuck in your bunker. </p>

                <p> 3. Food </p>

                <p> 4. First Aid </p>

                <p> 5. Tools </p>

                <p> 6. Batteries </p>

                <p> 7. Important documents </p>

                <p> 8. Warm clothes </p>
