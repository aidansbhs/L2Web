                <p>
                    For starters, minimizing the amount of time in the wasteland is a must as you are constantly exposing yourself to radiation and other environmental factors. While it is true that there is "safety in numbers" you shouldn't look to bring your whole group or more people than required as this will slow down the groups mobility and therefore the whole process will take longer. While travelling in the wasteland, you need to be alert and ready as there is no telling what's out there and when danger can arrive. If raiding and looting, you should only take the most important items such as food and water, so a good place to search would be supermarkets. Additionally you should always be on the lookout for other survivors but be caesious as they may not be as friendly as you think.
