                    In the event of a global disaster or apocalypse, it will be highly unlikely that there will be an hopsitals or clinics operating, therfore you will need to learn some basic first aid.
                </p>
                <p>
                    One of the main acronyms used in first aid is DRSABCD, which describes the following:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bold">D</div>anger - always check for danger before tending to the injured or ill person, otherwise you could become a liability.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bold">R</div>esponse - is the person conscious? Do they respond when you talk to them, touch or squeeze their shoulder?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bold">S</div>end for help - while the chance of someone coming to help you is low, still try calling 111 or other ways of contacting
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bold">A</div>irway - is the person's airway clear? Are they breathing?
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bold">B</div>reathing - check for breathing by looking for chest movements or listen by putting your ear next to their mouth and nose. Next, carefully turn them onto their side and monitor their condition.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bold">C</div>PR - Make sure they are flat on their back and place one hand in the center of their chest and the other on top. Press firmly and smoothly 30 times.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <div class="bold">D</div>efibrillator - if the person is unconscious and not breathing after all of those steps, apply an automated external defibrillator(AED) if avaliable. Just follow the instructions and pictures on the machine as it should be fairly simple to operate.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <h6>First Aid Kit</h6>
                <p>
                    As well as knowing some basic first aid techniques, it is important that you have a first aid kit that is fully stocked and readily available at all times.

                    The contents should be appropriate to cope with a range of emergency situations, depending on the setting. It’s a good idea to have a number of kits handy in different places.
                </p>
                <h6>Infected wounds</h6>
                <p>Open wounds are prone to infection, to reduce the risk of that happening apply these tips:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Wash your hands if possible before managing the wound.</li>
                    <li>Put on the disposable gloves provided in your first aid kit.</li>
                    <li>Try to avoid breathing or coughing over the wound.</li>
                    <li>Cleaning of the wound depends on the type and severity of the wound, including the severity of the bleeding. You may just clean around the wound.
                    </li>
                    <li>Cover the wound with a sterile dressing. Try not to touch the dressing’s surface before applying it to the wound.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>In an emergency, these suggestions may not be practical. If the injured person is bleeding heavily, don’t waste time. For example, cleaning the wound might dislodge a blood clot and make the wound bleed again or bleed more.</p>
                <p>Immediately apply pressure to a heavily bleeding wound (or around the wound if there is an embedded object), and apply a bandage when the bleeding has slowed down or stopped.</p>
